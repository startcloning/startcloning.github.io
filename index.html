							as small as a cell and as big as an entire organism such as an animal.</p>
							<p align="left"> Along with the advantages cloning has given to the human race in medical advances, it also brings large

							<HR>
     			<p align="left"><strong>Somatic cells</strong> are any cells found within the body, excluding sperm and egg.<br><br>
			<strong> Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer </strong> was the method used to produce the famous clone, Dolly The Sheep. </p>
                            <p align="left"><strong>1.</strong> When doing a somatic cell nuclear transfer, scientists remove somatic cells from an animal they wish to clone.<br><br> 
								<strong>2.</strong> Next, they remove the nucleus from the somatic cell and transfer it to an egg cell that has no nucleus. <br>This step is assisted by an electrical current that allows the membranes to fuse and become one cell.
								<br><br><strong>3.</strong> Once fertilized, it develops into an embryo which is implanted into a surrogate mother. <br>The animal produced contains the exact same genetic material as the animal that donated the somatic cell.</p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p align="left" class="item-intro"><strong>Abnormal Epigenome</strong></p>
							<HR>
							<p align="left"><strong>Epigenetic tags</strong> allow the genes to switch on or off, which is what allows for the expression of specific traits and tells the cell to perform its given task. </p>
							<p align="left"><strong>Imprinted genes</strong> do not follow the normal rule of inheritance because both alleles are not equally expressed.
											<br>Unlike co-dominance or incomplete dominance, imprinted genes cause either <strong>the maternal or paternal gene to be expressed exclusively.</strong> </p>
							<p align="left"> During normal reproduction, the offspring will receive one copy of the genes from its mother and one copy from its father. 
											Imprinted genes are genes that stay in the organism for the duration of its life. Certain genes are <strong>“epigenetically silenced”</strong> because they only inherit one working copy from either parent. </p>
							<p align="left">Cloning animals through the process of SCNT can lead to many difficulties. 
											When the nucleus is removed from the somatic cell, it already has different epigenetic tags. 
											<br>The epigenetic tags in the nucleus do not match those found in the donor egg cell and instead of expressing one set of imprinted genes, the animal will express both. 
											This leads to several health related problems for the cloned animal. </p>

							<p align="left">In 2009, scientists used the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer, in hopes of reviving an extinct mountain goat called the Bucardo.
											Scientists used a frozen tissue sample from this mountain goat which was a female; this meant they could only produce female mountain goats. </p>

                            <p align="left"><strong>DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid</strong> consists of the instructions for a living cell.
											In 1869, DNA was isolated by Friedrich Miescher but it was not until 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick were able to determine the structure of DNA. <br><br>The structure of DNA is called a <strong>double helix</strong>.

                            <p align="left">DNA consists of individual building blocks which are called <strong>nucleotides</strong>.
											Each nucleotide contains 3 parts; the phosphate group, the deoxyribose sugar and the nitrogenous base.   
											The nitrogenous bases pair up by a method called complimentary base-pairing:<br> 
											Adenine pairs with Thymine & Cytosine pairs with Guanine. </p>

													<strong>3.</strong>	The DNA fragments are incorporated into <strong>plasmids</strong>. These plasmids have matching ends to the DNA fragments.<br><br>
														<strong>4.</strong>	The plasmid and the DNA line up, and using an enzyme called <strong>DNA ligase</strong>, it forms a bond.<br><br>
															<strong>5.</strong>	Next, the plasmid is added into a bacterial host cell.<br><br>

								Not only does cloning raise several concerns regarding human rights, there is also the religious aspect to consider as well.</p>
							<p align="left"> Ever since cloning was introduced to society, humans have come to realize the issues that this technology will bring.
							It’s a question of what the appropriate cost is for medical advancements and the possibility of being able to clone ourselves. </p>
							<p align="left">The ethical debate over cloning humans has come to a standstill due to the overall consensus that the cloning of humans is just too dangerous. </p>

							<p align="left">Cloning has a high rate of failure. In the case of humans, the largest debate is whether or not the death of a clone is considered murder.</p>
							<p align="left">Tests on cloning animals have shown scientists that the rate of success is approximately 3%, meaning that 97% of human clones could potentially
							suffer from serious physical or mental disabilities, if they even make it into the world.  </p>
							<p align="left">Cloned animals have shown various developmental problems such as kidney defects, missing organs and being prone to infections.
							 A cloned animal’s lifespan is significantly less than that of a regular human.  These clones become very ill and are often euthanized early on in their lives. </p>
							<br>
							<p align="left" class="item-intro"><strong>Religion & Culture</strong></p>
								<HR>
							<p align="left">Religion and culture are a large factor when considering cloning because it goes against many people’s beliefs about human life.</p>
							<p align="left">Many believe that the ability to clone any human gives less purpose to one’s life, successes, discoveries and intelligence.
											Clones may be judged by their own community because people who know their origin, may see them as lesser of a human than those who were conceived naturally. </p>
							<p align="left">Many Christians believe that life is given by God and therefore, humans should not have the power to replicate someone who was specifically made as an individual from a higher power. </p>

							<p align="left" class="item-intro"><strong>Change in Society & The Family Dynamic</strong></p>
								<HR>
							<p align="left">In the arguments for cloning, some may say that if cloning can be done safely on animals, then it should be perfectly fine to do cloning for humans. 
							The problem with this statement is that animals cannot express how they feel about cloning. </p>
							<p align="left">Clones would have a lack of freedom and unique genetic identity. This could give rise to several health problems, both mental and physical. Cloning takes away the individuality of a human and can also lead to a future problem in terms of genetic diversity. 
							If people begin cloning their children instead of relying on natural fertilization, then there would not be a vast difference in the genetics of a population. </p>
							<p align="left">In a family setting, the clones might not meet the expectations of their parents, who have essentially decided their genetic makeup. If a couple is facing infertility and they decide to clone the mother, genetically speaking, their “daughter” would actually be the mother’s twin. 
								<br>This results in a very complicated family dynamic and changes the structure and nature of the family. </p>
